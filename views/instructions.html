          <p>Get started by remixing the Choose Your Adventure starter page.  Follow the directions below, and take a look at the GIF to the left if you have trouble finding the buttons.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Visit the Choose Your Adventure <a href="https://gomix.com/#!/project/choose-your-own-starter" target="_blank">starter page</a> and click "Remix". This gives you a new copy of the project to make your own!  You may have to wait a few seconds for your new project to load.  
            </li>
            <li>
              Your project starts with kind of a silly name.  
              Click the <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></i> next to your project name and then rename your project.
              You can also wait and do this later, and you can always rename your project!

          <p>Each chapter needs text and a passphrase.  At the end of each chapter, the reader needs a prompt and some choices. Each of those choices should be another chapter's passphrase. When they submit the passphrase of their choice, they'll be taken to the appropriate chapter! </p>
          
          <p>Start by planning your story.  If you are participating in the Mouse Maker Night, you should see some paper slips that you can use to plan your story.  Make sure that each chapter has at least two choices at the end!</p>

          <h3>Instructions:</h3>
          <p>Once you've planned your story, you need to input the chapter details into your app.</p>
          <p class="emphasis">Make sure that the passphrase for your first chapter is "INTRODUCTION".</p>
          <p>There are lots of ways to organize information in a way that computer programs can understand. We're using a format called JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation.  </p>
          <p>You'll be editing the file called <span class="file-name">chapters.js</span> in your editor.</p>
          <p>Inside the brackets ( [ and ] ), you'll see a list of what are called "objects".  Each object represents a chapter of your story.  It has a passphrase, text, a prompt, and an array of choices.  You'll need to fill in the details for each chapter of your story.</p>  
          <p>Notice that there are quotation marks around all of my text.  Also, notice that every time I used quotation marks in my story, I put them after a \ .  This is important!  You'll see that the slash and the quotation marks turn blue in the file.  That's good!  Be careful.  If the file is missing even a single comma, it will break your entire app!   Gomix will identify the location of any syntax issues in the gutter next to the line numbers.</p>
          <p>To help you make sure that all your chapters and choices are correctly linked, we run some quick validation on your chapters. If there are any issues, you'll be notified</p>

          <p>Once you can see your page, try making some choices.  Do you see the text you expect to? </p>

        </div>
        <div class="instructions-text">
          <p>A quick way to change the look of your site will be to change the background color of the page and of the text box that holds the chapter.</p>
          
          <p>Colors are represented by a series of six letters and numbers following a hashtag.  For example #24C3E2 represents this shade of <span class="aqua">aqua blue</span>. 
          #E224C9 represents this shade of <span class="hot-pink">hot pink</span>.  These numbers are called hex colors.</p>
          
          <p>You can use <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">this website</a> to help you find the color you want!  Then, follow the directions below to help change the color on your site!</p>

        </div>
        <div class="instructions-text">
          <p>Once you've picked the color you want for the background look at the file called <span class="file-name">public/custom-styles.css</span>.  There are two places where you can change the background color.  First, you can change the background color of the whole page by changing the <span class="css-property">background-color</span> value for <span class="css-element">body</span>.  Second, you can change the background color of the text of your chapter by changing the <span class="css-property">background-color</span> property of <span class="css-element">.chapter-text</span>.</p>

          </video>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions-text">
          <p>Next, you may want to change the fonts used on your page.  A great place to choose from a wide variety of fonts is the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> page.</p>
          <p>Select fonts you think you might like to use by clicking the <i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i> next to each font.  Once you have selected a few fonts, click the black box at the bottom of your page.  This will give you a line of code to copy that will look something like this:</p>
          <div class="code-snippet">&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Josefin+Sans|Roboto+Mono" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</div>
          <p>Copy that link and add it to line 15 of the file called <span class="file-name">views/index.html</span> in your editor.</p>
          <p>Now, your website has your new font available to it, but you haven't told your website where you want that font to go.  To do this, you'll go back to <span class="file-name">public/custom-styles.css</span>.  Replace the value of <span class="css-property">font-family</span> for <span class="css-element">#title</span> and <span class="css-element">#chapter-text</span> with the names of your new fonts.  (Make sure not to delete the quotation marks!)</p>

Any time you feel proud of what you've done, remix your own project so that you can keep a copy.  The real choose-your-own-adventure is about how you build your first app!</p>
